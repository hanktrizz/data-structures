# data-structures
Data Structures...the fundamental CS subject matter that mostly gets overlooked after graduation (myself included) until you are in one or more of these scenarios:
- you needed to implement something complex at work (something other than your average day-to-day CRUD, maybe?) and something beyond the realm of ArrayLists or Dictionaries was required to tackle the problem
- you are looking for a serious tech job
- you just failed your interviews for a serious tech job because your knowledge of DS let you down
- you feel like you have restricted your algorithmic thinking to only utilise lists and maps
- you saw some tech YouTubers challenging each other to mock coding interviews and you have no idea why they used what they used to tackle problems
- you simply want to be a programmer who has solid foundations in CS
- etc.

Well, whatever the reason is, you chanced upon this repository and might be dabbling with data structures. I hope that 
you can find some useful nuggets of information that you were looking for in terms of the essential CS Data Structures.

Personally, this project was written by me based on a combination of some of the scenarios above. You can either
watch videos to learn or you can get your hands dirty by "reinventing the wheel". This repo was the result of my exercise
in "reinvention".
